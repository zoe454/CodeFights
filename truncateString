#Consider the following operation on a string containing digits from 0 to 9:

if the leftmost digit of the string is divisible by 3, remove it from the string;
otherwise, if the rightmost digit of the string is divisible by 3, remove it from the string;
otherwise, if the sum of two digits on the sides of the string is divisible by 3, remove both digits from the string;
This operation is applied sequentially until the string is empty or neither of the three given conditions is met.

For a given string find the result of applying the given algorithm to it.
