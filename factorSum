#Consider the following operation - we take a positive integer nand replace it with the sum of its 
#prime factors (if a prime number is presented multiple times in the factorization of n, then 
#it's counted the same number of times in the sum). This operation is applied sequentially first to the given number, 
#then to the first result, then to the second result and so on, until the result remains the same.
#Given any number, find the final result of the operation.
